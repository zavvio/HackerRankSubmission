# HackerRankSubmission

This repository contains my final solution to any problem/challenge submission at "https://www.hackerrank.com"

**"Swear in your family's name to check the solution only after you have tried the problem yourself. BE FAITHFUL!"**

How to find the solution for each challenge?
--------------------------------------------
The filename is equivalent to that in the original URL from hackerrank;  
For example, https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles is named "birthday-cake-candles.cpp";  
The original challenge URL is also included on the first line of each file.

Why C or C++?
-------------
I am interested in programming at as low level as possible; if necessary, I will fill in assembly code.  
Python? This unique language is also on my radar for how broad and general it is.

Unsolved challenge?
-------------------
Solving programming challenge is my "snack", so obviously not a 24/7 thing but I'll take more when my stomach calls.
